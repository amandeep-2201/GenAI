"I am a teacher and I have made these notes for my students. These are not properly formatted. Use your creativity and format the notes in such a way that they are easy to read and understand. I just want to copy paste your response in my word file and won't make any further changes so do the job perfectly. Try to keep the content same."

So I gave this prompt to chat gpt and got my notes formatted instead of doing it manually and wasting my time in captalizing, bolding, etc.

The updated notes are in the file "1. Prompt Engineering"
and the raw notes are in the file "3. Raw Notes"
